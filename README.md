### Project 5: Public API Requests
Author - Hans Steffens

## Project Overview
This project is about to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

## Features

Using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

The app will request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
